Lowest Common Divisor (LCD)
=========================

This repository contains one of my first simple programs that I made during my first year when I was learning programming for the first time.

This simple program was written using the Pascal programming language and compiled on Mac OS 10.7 Lion. The executable has been packaged into an OS X disk image.

LCD is a console application that calculates the largest common divisor of two numbers when executed.
You can drag this application to any directory inside your mac or you can execute it directly from the disk image by double clicking the executable.
